# Head First Design Patterns : Ruby

I'm currently reading Head First Design Patterns and am also trying to get more comfortable in Ruby. SO. That naturally lends itself towards me trying to implement the concepts from the book but in Ruby instead of Java! From a quick google search, two others have attempted this, but neither have gotten far. The first gave up after Chapter 1, and the second after Chapter 2. By any luck, I'll get to Chapter 3 and (hopefully) beyond!

This is not meant to be a super structured repo, and so is barebones. Generally I separate each design pattern into its own folder. Within the folder is a `main.rb` file, which includes a class that executes code to display the design pattern. The design pattern itself is implemented across the other files.

And with that, best of luck learning these! Here's a haiku to get you in the mood:
